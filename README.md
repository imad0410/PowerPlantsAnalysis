# PowerPlantsAnalysis

## Description
This project automates the analysis and reporting of European power plants data. Using open-source data, it generates detailed Excel reports with insights on energy capacity, technologies used, and geographical distribution.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Analysis by:
  - Country (total capacity, number of plants).
  - Energy source (natural gas, coal, etc.).
  - Technology (combined cycle, steam turbine, etc.).
- Automated Excel report generation.
- Modular and extensible script.

## Data Source
The dataset contains information about conventional power plants in Europe, including:
- Name of the plant.
- Country and location.
- Capacity (MW).
- Energy source and technology.

The original data is open-source and can be accessed at [Open Power Plants Data](https://open-power-system-data.org/).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later.
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imad0410/PowerPlantsAnalysis.git
